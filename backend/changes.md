# Changes Made to ExpensePilot Spring Boot Project

## 1. Fixed Compilation Errors in ExpenseController.java
- Completed the `updateExpense` method by adding missing return statements and closing braces.
- Removed invalid commented code inside the class that could cause compilation issues.

## 2. Dockerfile Build Process Explained
- The Dockerfile uses a multi-stage build:
  1. **Build Stage**: Uses a Maven image to run `mvn clean package -DskipTests` and build your Spring Boot JAR.
  2. **Runtime Stage**: Uses an OpenJDK image to run the built JAR file.
- This process ensures your application is compiled and packaged before being deployed in a lightweight Java runtime container.

## 3. Port Binding for Render.com
- Updated `application.properties` to use `server.port=${PORT:8080}` so the app listens on the port provided by Render.

## 4. Health Check Endpoint
- Added `/api/health` endpoint in `ExpenseController.java` that returns HTTP 200 OK for Render health checks.

## 5. Dockerfile Improvements
- Verified `EXPOSE 8080` is present.
- Added `CMD ["java", "-jar", "app.jar"]` to ensure the container runs the Spring Boot JAR file.

## 6. Next Steps
- The project should now compile successfully. If you run `mvn clean package` or build with Docker, the errors should be resolved.
- If further errors occur, check for similar syntax issues in other files.
- Redeploy to Render.com. The app should now start correctly and respond to health checks, resolving the 502 Bad Gateway error.
- If you use a database in production, update datasource settings accordingly.
