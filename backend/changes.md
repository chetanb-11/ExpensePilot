# Changes Made to ExpensePilot Spring Boot Project

## 1. Fixed Compilation Errors in ExpenseController.java
- Completed the `updateExpense` method by adding missing return statements and closing braces.
- Removed invalid commented code inside the class that could cause compilation issues.

## 2. Dockerfile Build Process Explained
- The Dockerfile uses a multi-stage build:
  1. **Build Stage**: Uses a Maven image to run `mvn clean package -DskipTests` and build your Spring Boot JAR.
  2. **Runtime Stage**: Uses an OpenJDK image to run the built JAR file.
- This process ensures your application is compiled and packaged before being deployed in a lightweight Java runtime container.

## 3. Next Steps
- The project should now compile successfully. If you run `mvn clean package` or build with Docker, the errors should be resolved.
- If further errors occur, check for similar syntax issues in other files.
